# ML-Pipeline-Using-Prepayment-factors-of-Mortgage-Loans

## Overview

The ML-Pipeline for Mortgage Risk Assessment is a web-based application designed to provide users with a straightforward interface for assessing mortgage-related risks. The project incorporates both classification and regression models to address specific aspects of risk: the "Ever Delinquent" classification model and the "Prepayment Risk" regression model.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to offer users a user-friendly platform for mortgage risk assessment. Users can interact with a simple HTML page where they input relevant information, such as mortgage details and borrower information. The two main functionalities include:

1. **Ever Delinquent Classification Model:**
   - Users can input mortgage-specific information.
   - Clicking the "Classification Model" button triggers the underlying classification model, providing a prediction on whether the mortgage is likely to become delinquent.

2. **Prepayment Risk Regression Model:**
   - Similar to the classification model, users input necessary data.
   - Clicking the "Regression Model" button invokes the regression model, offering a prediction on the prepayment risk associated with the mortgage.

## How to Use

1. **Input Data:**
   - Fill in the required details on the HTML page. This may include mortgage amount, interest rate, borrower's credit score, and other relevant information.

2. **Ever Delinquent Classification:**
   - Click the "Classification Model" button to receive a prediction on whether the mortgage is likely to become delinquent.

3. **Prepayment Risk Regression:**
   - Click the "Regression Model" button to obtain a prediction on the prepayment risk associated with the mortgage.
